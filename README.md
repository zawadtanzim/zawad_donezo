# Donezo Full Stack Application

This project was built as an assignment to create a full-stack CRUD application.

## Backend

The backend is very simple. It connects to Supabase using Prisma (which is allowed and (documented)[https://supabase.com/partners/integrations/prisma] how to do).
There is no authentication being handled here, only Authorization.

For more information on the backend, please look at the README in the backend folder 


## Frontend

The frontend is a React Single Page Application. It connects to Supabase via it's Authentication service and does have a Supabase Client initialized.
